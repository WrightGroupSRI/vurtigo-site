Vurtigo Features include:
 
 **Extensible Plugin Architecture** The Vurtigo core provides support for rendering and controlling objects. Plugins provide the main features, input/output, etc. Plugins can be licensed separately (SDK to be released soon)
 
 **3D/4D Roadmaps** Load and navigate multiple DICOM datasets; supports cine datasets
 
 **Multiple Modality Datasets** MR, CT (DICOM images with geometry information), JPEG/PNG
 
 **DICOM Database** Storage of DICOM images. Query and retrieve images from remote DICOM nodes
 
 **Volume Rendering** Configurable rendering modes and properties, GPU acceleration
 
 **Surface Rendering** Can be used to display segmented datasets
 
 **Mesh Painting** Paint a surface using data from points
 
 **Configurable Visualization Layout** 3D Only, 2D + 3D views, 2D only, multiple 3D windows
 
 **3D Points** Create, manipulate and filter (based on configurable properties) 3D point clouds
 
 **Scanner Communication** Can connect to real-time scan information via the Geometry Server (included) or [OpenIGTLink](http://openigtlink.org/). The Geometry Server can work with compatible scanner console software such as [HeartVista's](https://www.heartvista.ai/) [RTHawk Research](https://www.heartvista.ai/for-research) (not included)
 
 **Real-time Imaging** Display and control multiple interactive real-time imaging planes within the 3D view
 
 **Catheter Visualization** Display multiple actively tracked catheters in 3D view
 
 **Catheter Following** Update real-time imaging planes or static roadmap planes based on catheter position
 
 **Capturing Results** Save screenshots and image streams
 
 **Interactive Landmark Registration** Rigid, Affine, Similarity, and Thin Plate Spline landmark-based registration
 
 **Extensible Object Framework** Define new types of objects for Vurtigo to render
 
 **2D Plots** Framework for creating and displaying interactive 2D graphs
 
 **ROI Contours** Draw contours on images or surfaces
 
 **Mesh tool** Create a surface from contours
 
 **Mask tool** Create a masked volume from contours
 
 **Import tool** Import images, meshes, and volumes from external formats
