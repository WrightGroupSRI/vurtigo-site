We thank Graham A. Wright, the senior scientist who has guided this project from its inception. We would also like to thank all previous contributors to Vurtigo, in particular Stefan Pintilie who designed version 1.0, Roey Flor who subsequently led development through version 3.0, and Perry Radau, who provided technical guidance through the development of Vurtigo to the release of version 3.1.

Vurtigo has been made possible through the financial support of the Strategic Innovation Fund, the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, the Ontario Research Fund, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Thanks also to [Percept Imaging](http://perceptimaging.ca/), for their assistance in preparing the latest release.
